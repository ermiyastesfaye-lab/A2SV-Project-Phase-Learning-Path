# Project Description

This is a simple Todo List web application. It allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and manage their daily to-dos. The project consists of three main files:

- index.html: The main HTML structure for the app.
- style.css: Styles for the Todo List interface.
- main.js: JavaScript logic for adding and displaying tasks.

## Instructions for Running

- Make sure all three files (index.html, style.css, main.js) are in the same folder.
- Open index.html in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- The Todo List app will load and you can start adding tasks.
